        <div class="about__text">
            <p>Hello, I'm Daniel, a 24 year old Web Developer and Designer who's on track to achieve a 2:1 in Computer
                Science at Royal Holloway University of London in May '23.
                I've had a lifelong passion for all things creative, I love creating applications, playing basketball,
                designing and creating clothes and baking lemon drizzle's. My dream is to one day be able to combine my
                programming and fashion skills to create garments that
                'come alive'. I've chosen to begin my career in web development as it allows me to nurture my
                programming skills as well as inject some creative flair into my work.</p>
